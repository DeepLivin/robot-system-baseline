[31m[1mCMake Error[0m at /home/james/catkin_ws/src/han2um_test/CMakeLists.txt:215 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findoctomap.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "octomap", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "octomap" with any
  of the following names:

    octomapConfig.cmake
    octomap-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "octomap" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "octomap_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "octomap" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
